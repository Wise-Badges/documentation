# CREATING THE PRODUCT

## Branding

Did you create a new branding? Or did you base yourself on an existing branding? How did you use it? Did you change/improve something? Did you make a style guide or style tiles? If you had an existing branding but didn&#39;t change anything, you won&#39;t have to include it.

##

## Sketches, wireframes &amp; mockups

Include wireframes and sketches, explain in clear language that&#39;s understandable for everyone what you can see here.

## Frontend

Describe how it works, stack you&#39;ve chosen, and why. Some information in here you can reuse for your README or vice versa.

## Backend

Describe how it works, stack you&#39;ve chosen, and why. Some information in here you can reuse for your README or vice versa.

## Communication plan

If you had a communication profile on your team, describe how you&#39;re going to share your product with the world.

# Feedback

## User testing

## How did you test your sketches, wireframes or mockups? What were the results?

## Improvements

## What did you learn? What did you change? Did you add a feature or removed one?

# THE FUTURE

## Added value for the open source / open data community

Who can work with the code you made? What happens to the data? Who else can benefit, or build later?

## To be implemented

Do you have some more wireframes or code ready for new features?

## Fixes &amp; Bugs

Are there any bugs, or things that need fixing soon?

## Future features and ideas

What would make the product even better? What would be some nice added value? What could be a nice project for the next open summer of code?

## Longevity

# documentation
future ideas: 
- sort of validation: only someone who received the badge can give it etc.
- some kind of mechanism if someone received a badge multiple times
